Dear Professor Guerrero,
Thank you for the opportunity to learn from your experience and knowledge in this class.
It has been incredibly challenging for me, for personal reasons.  Unfortunately, I have in many times had to choose between family care, and homework.  My wife is undergoing a medical treatment and at times it can be incredibly stressful.
While it may seem like I haven't put in the work into the assignments, I hope this is not a reflection of my respect for the class, as I have definitely learned a lot and hope to spend more time reviewing the materials.
I also appreciate being able to share with you some last thoughts on the class, before transitioning into the next.
Please see the following notes, which I believe are not adequate but hopefully a glimpse into my thoughts regarding the class:
Q: What was your favorite topic or project in the course and why?
	I thoroughly enjoyed the phong shading and shadows.  This particular part of the course is where the content hit the road so to speak, and really made sense.
Q: If you could improve any aspect of this course what would it be and why?
	There were a few times that I was confused by the videos and was often searching for additional information in the textbooks and videos to learn more about the related content
	I appreciated when you had included additional videos like three blue one brown, in order to further understand concepts.
	When I found myself struggling later in the course I reverted to looking through a lot of irrelevant information to find something that I could apply to the problems at hand.
	If you could include more links to content that you believe would be relevant I think that would help a struggling student.
	
	Lastly, I wonder if there is a way to encourage more collaboration among the students?  Perhaps, and this is of course just a suggestion, encourage a topic review.
	In one of the past courses we had an opportunity for the group to present how they logically worked through a problem, which enabled other students to learn from them and build their knowledge.

	
Sincerely,
Daniel
